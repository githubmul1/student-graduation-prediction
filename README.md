# 🎓 Student Graduation Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail 
based on study hours and attendance using Logistic Regression.

This is my first Machine Learning classification project 
built using Python and Scikit-learn.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains:
- study_hours
- attendance
- passed (target variable)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data Preparation
2. Train-Test Split
3. Model Training (Logistic Regression)
4. Model Evaluation

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report

---

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
python train.py
